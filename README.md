## Using cmg.exe

### Parameters
| Short | Long | Required | Description |
| ----- | -----| -------- | ----------- |
| -o | -output | yes | Output path 
| -n | -namespace | yes | The namespace for the generated classes
| -p | -project | no | Path to the EPiServer web project
| -c | -connectionString | no | Override connection string (if not same as project web.config)
| -v | -connectionProvider | no | Override connection provider name (if other than SQL)
| -b | -generateBaseClasses | no | Aggregates common properties into base classes
| -r | -reflectExistingClases | no | Merges reflected properties (from project) with database content types

### Examples
In this case we want to just generate classes from Commerce
``` 
cmg -c {connectionString} -n Project.Web.Features.Models -o c:\temp\projectclasses
```

In this case we want to read back existing project classes, merge them into base classes and merge it with newly added commerce data.
``` 
cmg -p c:\projects\project\src\project.web -n Project.Web.Features.Models -o c:\temp\projectclasses -b -r
```
